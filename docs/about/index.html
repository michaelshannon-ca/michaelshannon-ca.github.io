<b>Seasoned Product &amp; Systems Architect</b><br />
With <b>over 24 years in the computer security industry</b>, I combine a strong technical foundation with executive-level insight — backed by my <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Certified_Information_Systems_Security_Professional" target="_blank">CISSP</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Certified_Information_Systems_Security_Professional" target="_blank">CISSP</a> certifications. My journey has involved everything from low-level reverse engineering to high-level cloud architectures, always blending business needs with technological advancements to give organizations a competitive edge in the evolving cybersecurity landscape. I possess a deep understanding of both the technical and business dynamics, enabling me to bridge gaps and drive strategic success.

<b>More Than Just a Technologist</b><br />
Outside of my professional sphere, I am a father, an avid <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maker_culture" target="_blank">maker</a> and a passionate outdoor enthusiast. Balancing family life, hands-on projects, and time in nature helps me stay creative, grounded, and inspired. These personal facets not only shape who I am but also inform my approach to problem-solving and team leadership in the professional realm.
